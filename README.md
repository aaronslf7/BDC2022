# BDC 2022
This is my submission for the 2022 Big Data Cup using data provided by Stathletes. This project focused on quantifying and comparing the scoring chances created from different zone entry conditions.

This repo contains three separate R scripts:
xG_model.R contains the regression I used to get each shot an expected goal value.
All_Zone_Entries+Shots.R contains the code used to get all zone entries and shots taken within ten seconds of the entry.
Zone_Entries_by_Condition.R contains the code used to get the expected goals per zone entry of different entry conditions.

Finally, I have also attached a pdf copy of a report I wrote that summarizes my findings.

# Thank you for checking out my project!
